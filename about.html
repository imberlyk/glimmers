  <h2 class="fade-in">“A glimmer is the exact opposite of a trigger—it is some kind of cue, either internal or external that brings one back to a sense of joy or safety” <br> (Newport Institute, 2023)</h2>
  <h1 class="fade-in">And yes, we intimately know the origins of oppression; it brewed in our beds, tables and streets;
    screaming out in anger is a necessary stage in our evolution into freedom, but we do have to dwell
    forever on that piece of terrain, forever stuck in the middle of that bridge? (…) We carry this bridge in us, the struggle, the movement into liberation.
    No doubt all of us found by now that you don’t build bridges by storming walls - that only put peoples
    back up. No acts of barging in the door (...) but turning away, walking away from those, who are not
    ready yet to hear us, who perhaps can never hear us. To stand our ground with those who look us in
    the eye, to wait for that glimmer of recognition to pass between us, to let the force of our being penetrate the other with gentleness. Touching is an act of making love, and if political touching is not made with love, no connections, no linkings happen.”
    <br>(Gloria Anzaldúa, Acts of healing, 1983)
